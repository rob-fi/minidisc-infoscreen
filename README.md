# Sony MDS-B5 Infoscreen
Disc and track information for current and previous discs

This is a terrible bash script that generates a text based info screen displaying the current and previously played discs and tracks on a Sony MDS-B5 minidisc deck via the RS232 port.

Requires that picocom be installed.

Optimised for a 800x480 display with the console font changed and size increased.
